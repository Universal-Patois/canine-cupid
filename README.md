## Introduction
Canine Cupid is a webpage designed to find you the perfect furry friend match. You choose the personality that resonates with you the most and BAM you have a list of dogs that will match that will match you perfectly.

## Learning Goals 
- Learn a new technology that wasn't taught and implement it in the project.
- Use TypeScript to create a webpage that allowed one user to interact with the data.

## Features
When you visit the homepage of the app, seven different personalities are displayed in front of you as well as eight featured dogs below that. As a user you can choose a personality and click 'Find a Match!' that will lead you to a matches page displaying all dogs that fit in that personality.

A user can also favorite a dog they want to save and look at on the favorites page. A user can also click on the info icon and be taken to a page that displays information for a specific dog.

The title and logo are used as a link back to the homepage and you are able to explore this webpage by clicking on 'Favorites' and 'Matches'

## Setup
1. Fork this repo - on the top right corner of this page, click the **Fork** button. 
2. Clone down the forked repo. To rename your project you can use an optional argument when you run git clone (you replace the [...] with the terminal command arguments): `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`
3. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the page running in your browser on `http://localhost:3000/`. `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server.  Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems. This command is not specific to Webpack; make note of it for future use. 
7. Enjoy!

## Future Additions
- Adding inputs for the user to enter personality traits that would match dogs and the type of personality they are.

## Technologies
This project used TypeScript, React, React Router, CSS. Cypress Testing was also used. Additional technologies learned specifically for this project included Swiper, testing accessibility using LightHouse, and making network requests to fetch information from an API.
